## Retrieve
Retrieve is to be submitted or approved the instance back to reprocess.

There are two types of people that can retrieve an instance: one is the new intance of people, the other is the approval of intance people.
Note: The intance can only be retrieved after the next step has not been processed or the next step is not the end of the processing steps. For example, a new intance has been submitted, if you want to modify this intance, but this intance has been approved by the leadership, this intance can not be retrieved.

- When you retrieve a new instance, you can find this intance in the "in progress". (Note: this intance has not been approved by the next approver)
