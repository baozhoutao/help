## Fill in application form
 As a general user, you just need to initiate a request and fill in the form as required. Before that, admins have finished form designs and permission settings. Detailed steps are listed below.
- Select your workspace for workflow after you log in steedos.
- Click the “New” button and select a flow.
- Fill in the application form as required.
- Click the U-shaped button, select a file path, and you can **upload** one or more attachments that will be visible at the bottom of the form. Move the cursor to an attachment, and an X-shaped icon will appear. By clicking the icon, you can **delete** the attachment.
- Save the form in time if there is no need to submit it at once. Then submit your application form.

#### Notice：
- You are supposed to change the initiator if you submit the application for others. The default state of the systems set the account owner to be the initiator.
- You are supposed to fill in all the fields marked with icon“＊”. If not, you cannot submit the form.
- Those fields that are not required to be filled in manually, e. g. price (unit price * quantity) and total (the sum of... ), will be calculated automatically according to the settings of the administrator.
